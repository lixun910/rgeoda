\description{
REDCAP (Regionalization with dynamically constrained agglomerative
clustering and partitioning) is developed by D. Guo (2008). Like SKATER, REDCAP
starts from building a spanning tree with 4 different ways (single-linkage, average-linkage, ward-linkage
and the complete-linkage). The single-linkage way leads to build a minimum spanning tree.
Then,REDCAP provides 2 different ways (first-order and full-order constraining) to
prune the tree to find clusters. The first-order approach with a minimum spanning tree is
exactly the same with SKATER. In GeoDa and pygeoda, the following methods are provided:
\* First-order and Single-linkage
\* Full-order and Complete-linkage
\* Full-order and Average-linkage
\* Full-order and Single-linkage
\* Full-order and Ward-linkage
